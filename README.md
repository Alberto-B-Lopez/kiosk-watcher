# Kiosk-Watcher

This project marks my initial foray into using Go as a backend paired with HTMX for the frontend. It is my first server-side rendering (SSR) application that also incorporates cookie-based sessions. While the implementation could benefit from improvements, particularly regarding race conditions, it remains a work in progress that I plan to revisit in the future.

## Future Enhancements

I am considering the integration of WebSockets. A local implementation has been successfully tested, but I intend to ensure its stability and functionality before updating this repository.
